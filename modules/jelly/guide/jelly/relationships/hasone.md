#### `Jelly_Field_HasOne` (1:1)

This is exactly the same as `Jelly_Field_HasMany` with the exception that Jelly ensures that the model can only *have* one other model, instead of many.

	// In Model_Author::initialize()
	'posts' => Jelly::field('hasone', array(
		'foreign' => 'post.author:foreign_key',
	)),

**Properties**

**`foreign`** â€” The model that this field has many of. You can also pass a field to use as the foreign model's foreign key.

	// The default, using the above example
	'foreign' => 'post.author:foreign_key',

**`convert_empty`** â€” This defaults to TRUE, unlike most other fields. Empty values are converted to the value set for `empty_value`, which defaults to `0`.

**`empty_value`** â€” This is the default value that empty values are converted to. The default is `array()`.

**`delete_dependent`** â€” If this value is `TRUE` the dependent field is automatically deleted upon deletion. The default is `FALSE`.

**Using this relationship**

	// Build query
	$author = Jelly::query('author', 1);

	// 1:1 relationships can be joined upon querying using the 'with()' method,
	// in this case author has one post
	$post->with('post');

	// Select the author only if the post is approved (notice the ':' before the joined models)
	$post->where(':post.approved_by', '!=', '0')->select();

	// Access the post's name
	$author->post->name;

	// Retrieve the post only if it's published
	$author->get('post')->where('status', '=', 'published')->select();

	// Delete the post
	$author->get('post')->delete();

	// Remove the relationship
	$author->post = NULL;
	$author->save();
